              This is site was commissioned by a photographer who was
              undertaking a project to take a photo a day during 2019. The site
              needed to allow the user to independently post her photos and
              other information direct to the website. A Sanity.io headless
              Content Management Service (CMS) was used to achieve this goal.
              The site is hosted on Netlify (free tier). Each time the user
              added her photos to the CMS the site would automatically update.
              This is a great advantage of the JAMstack approach to web
              development. The technology used to build the site is listed
              below.

              The client brief for a Wordpress site but was not to use an
              existing Theme. We build a clean uncluttered site using the
              Wordpress backend (CMS). Currently the site has no TLS certificate
              as the site is being transitioned to a Gastby based site which
              will continue to use the Wordpress CMS. The techology used to
              build the current site is listed below.
